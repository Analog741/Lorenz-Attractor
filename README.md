## Lorenz Attractor

This is an excellent demonstration of an **analog computer**, taken from an outstanding lesson
by Professor [Paul Horowitz](https://youtu.be/DBteowmSN8g?si=P4ycZDwNGiXzkuB8).  
The Lorenz attractor arises as the solution to a set of three coupled nonlinear differential equations, which, for certain values of
the parameters, a, b, and c, exhibit chaotic behaviour [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system).

## Analog Computer

The differential equations are solved using an analog computer implemented as an electronic circuit.  
Integration is performed by operational amplifiers (op-apmps) whith capacitors in their feedback loop, and the integrated signals are
multiplied using an MPY634 multiplication IC. Here is the circuit that represents the solution to the differential equations.

## Experimental Setup
I used two Texas Instruments general-purpose ÂµA741CP op-amps and one TI LF411 instead of the original LF412, and, instead of the more expensive
MPY634, I used two Analog Devices AD633JNs. I also used two precision potentiometers to adjust the values of resistors R3 and R7. Here is a
picture of the circuit assembled, along with the power supply and oscilloscope.

## Python Script

One can also model the response of this system of differential equations using a Python script (**lorenz.py**) which uses the SciPy
module **odeint** to solve ordinary differential equations.
